## Overview

The Boids algorithm is a behavior model which simulates flocking behavior found
in the wild exhibited by animals like birds and fish. This implementation is
written in C using the SDL2 graphics library. I have been able to get decent
performance using quadtrees.

Quadtrees are a data structure that can efficiently store and retrieve objects
in a 2D space. By dividing the space into smaller quadrants recursively,
quadtrees can reduce the number of objects that need to be checked for collision
detection or proximity testing, thus improving the performance of the swarming
algorithm.

I have added custom widgets to the interface which allow the users to customize
the various parameters of the swarming algorithm, such as speed, separation,
alignment, and cohesion. The software also has different view modes that allows
the user to zoom in, follow a particular boid, and view the vectors generated by
the various rules in a debug mode. The debug mode also shows how the quadtree is
structured.
